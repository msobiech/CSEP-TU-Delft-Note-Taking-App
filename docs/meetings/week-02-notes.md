- Feedback 
  - Avoid talking about agenda points in depth before the meeting.
  - Simple questions preferable.
  - Again better time management needed but this time was much better than last time

  - Discussion on work distribution was confusing and could've been more streamlined.
- Meeting closed 15:28 but no announcements by TA so we are good.
