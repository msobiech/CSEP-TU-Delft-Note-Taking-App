# Meeting Week 2 - 20-Nov-2024
#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Good
Feedback:
- The agenda was added in time to the repository and followed the template
- The individual points were clearly formulated. The expected times for each point were too long, so I'd suggest paying a little more attention to these in the future so the meeting doesn't end too quickly.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Quick Summary: Insufficient
Feedback:

#### Chair performance
Quick Summary: Good
Feedback: 
- Very good, all the topics on the agenda were properly discussed
- The expected times for each point were too long, so I'd suggest paying a little more attention to these in the future so the meeting doesn't end too quickly.


#### Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Good
Feedback: 
- The team was in charge of the whole meeting, which is very good.
- Most of the team was active the whole meeting; however, there were 2 members who were less active (still active, just a little quiet in comparison with the other). I'd love to see everyone equally involved in the upcoming meetings
- The atmosphere was constructive and everyone listened to all the ideas/comments/questions. Keep up the good work!
