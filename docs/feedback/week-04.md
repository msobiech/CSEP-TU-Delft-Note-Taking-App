#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- the agenda was there in time, so everyone had time to prepare the the points
- the general template is good, but I think that some of the times can be reduced (for example, the check-in usually doesn't take 5 mintues)
- the points were clearly formulated, so everyone had the chance to prepare them

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 
- very good notes, very detailed

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- the action list of last week was discussed and it seems like everyone worked on diffenet parts of the project. However, based on the milestones, it seems like there are parts that were not completed. This is not necessarily an issue, but I would suggest to pay a little more attention to the amount of work assigned for each week.
