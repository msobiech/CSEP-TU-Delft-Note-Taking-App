# Meeting Week 6 - 18-Dec-2024
#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- very good agenda, with clear points. The only thing that I would complain about is the agenda being pushed the afternoon before the meeting, so I am not sure if everyone had time to prepare it

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- very good notes, very detailed
- it seems like Maks' contribution is missing from the check-in part
- I think that some abreviations can be expanded, for more clarity (for exmaple, I am not sure what **AP** means). Also, the part with "**AP**" is the same with the one from week 3, maybe it wasn't updated?

#### Chair performance
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- the chair ensured that all the points in the agenda are covered for the right amount of time


#### Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 
- team took ownership of the meeting, everyone was involved in the meeting, the atmosphere is constructive, keep it like this :D


#### Potentially Shippable Product
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- there are not a lot of new changes to the app (mainly because of the midterms week), but the new changes are properly implemented
- all the presented changes were merged to main, which is very good
- the team is on a good track to create a working application with extended functionality
- Keep up the good work :D

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 
- everyone presented their changes, it seems like everyone finished their assigned task. Great job!
