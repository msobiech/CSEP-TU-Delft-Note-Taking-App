# Meeting Week 3 - 27-Nov-2024
#### Agenda 
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:
- the agenda was there in time, so everyone had time to prepare the points
- the general template is good, but I think that some of the points can be merged (for example the opening and the check-in)
- most of the points are clearly formulated, however, some can go a little more into details. For example, "Using the Model - View - Controller Design Pattern (MVC)" might not be completely clear for all members. There is no word limit on the agenda, so a short description might work from time to time

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- the notes were properly added to the repo, and the format is good
- in general the notes seem clear, however some of them might need to be a little more explicit. For example, after a week, for a person who didn't attend the meeting, the following note: 
"- [Friday]
  - Distribution of work" might not make a lot of sense
- there are no concrete agreements in the notes nor people to tasks

#### Chair performance
Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 
- all topics were properly covered
- most of the tasks were covered in the desired time frame. For the upcoming meetings, I would suggest removing the parts related to TA announcements or feedback and including them in the relevant subquestions (for example the feeback can be included in the product presentation)

#### Attitude & Relation
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- not everyone was equally active, I am looking forward to see everyone involved in the upcoming meeting
- the atmosphere was constructive and everyone listened to most of the ideas/comments/questions. However, from time to time, there were discussions in small pairs (2-3 people), so not everyone was able to listen to everything and contribute to all ideas. I'd suggest in the future to focus on one point at a time

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 
- there's a good start, but not shippable project yet

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- the students discussed (some of) the goals of the last week, but it was hard for me to follow all of them, as they were not clearly stated anywhere. There were some issues, but not everyone has assigned issues. I would suggest to make a clear overview of the work and post it somewhere (notes can be updated, another document is also fine, issues can also work, but everyone needs to have some assigned ones and be sure that you discuss all of them in the upcoming meeting)
